# Current state and open work

Updated: 2026-10-12.

## Implementation

Rust controls HTTP service, request scheduling, and logical KV cache. Python controls one B200 GPU.
Use 784-token blocks, 16 FA layers, 48 GDN layers, and `mamba_cache_mode="align"`.
The total input and output limit is 262144 tokens.

Ordinary decoding, MTP4, and DSpark are startup choices.
Chat, Responses, streams, tools, thinking settings, constraints, cancellation, and prefix reuse stay available.
DSpark keeps fixed weights and target features `(5,19,33,47,61)`.
Its Markov proposals and cumulative confidence select zero through seven candidates, with initial threshold `0.2`.
Stochastic acceptance uses `min(1,p/q)`, normalized `max(p-q,0)` after rejection, and a target bonus after full acceptance.

CUDA Graph, multiple streams, and PDL control model execution.
All owned CUDA backend code files meet the 800-line limit. The pre-commit hook uses clang-format 23.1.3.
Header content enters build keys, load provenance, formal contracts, and profiler checks.

Prefix identities enter lookup after validated worker state commit.
Admission leases have count and byte limits for queued requests, prepared requests, encoded history, output state, and completed stream drains.
The HTTP supervisor invalidates old logical KV and loads replacement workers after failure.
Affected requests stop and report an error. Recovery keeps HTTP alive.

The worker step deadline has a positive configurable value, with a default of 120 seconds.
It includes first-use compilation and graph capture.

Compiler metadata has count and byte limits. Graph caches have count limits for resident entries and check capture headroom.
Compiler retirement starts garbage collection at safe host boundaries and keeps owners needed for resident graph replay.
Prefill admission accounts for planned storage. Graph pressure eviction releases unused pool owners.
DSpark graph recapture uses a cooldown for repeated shape changes.

[Architecture](architecture.md) specifies ownership and cache contracts.
[Service contracts](serving.md) specify budgets, worker recovery, and request timing.
[Development](development.md) gives portable environment selection. Keep host configuration in ignored `LOCAL.md`.

## Verification

The persistent-session collector keeps four OMP processes and histories, maximum effort, and runtime context usage.
It keeps incremental journals and checks provider-input anchors against service counts.
Formal acceptance also must have independent resource review.
The sampler keeps failed worker observations before GPU process lookup.
The collector stops the sampler before final checks and evidence hashes.

Rust tests, formatting, line width, Clippy, and CUDA formatting checks passed.
The CPU suite passed 1314 tests and 101 subtests, with 448 GPU cases deselected.
Additional context and compaction evidence regressions passed.

The new one-hour MTP4 and DSpark collections and revised fifteen phase workloads are pending.
Previous cold-start collections failed the worker step deadline. Their original records keep their failure status.
The collector uses a 600-second step deadline and an 1800-second request deadline without separate warmup.

Nine phase rows passed their gates on the previous measured source. Six rows are pending.
Short diagnostics and cancelled attempts keep their original status in external evidence.
[Acceptance](acceptance.md) identifies previous measurement scope. Those results do not certify the revised workload.

## Open work

- Extend `PY-04` to cross-shape graph eviction and recapture near the maximum supported context.
- Measure `PY-06` host overlap before a change to dependent host waits.
- Examine compiler storage with indefinitely changing shapes, using its fixed capacity contracts.
- Keep the heavy soak test explicit and do affected phase workloads again after runtime changes.
- Complete user review of the tutorial.

## Tutorial preview

The user-requested tutorial preview stays on port 18084.
Ignored `LOCAL.md` keeps its address, process identity, and maintenance commands.
The tutorial has thirteen Chinese chapters with current project source.
